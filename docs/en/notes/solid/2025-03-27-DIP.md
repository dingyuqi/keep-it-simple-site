## Definition
> 1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on their abstractions.
> 2. Abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions.

## Implementation Method
Introduce an abstract interface layer between high-level modules and low-level modules. The abstract interface is an abstraction of low-level modules, and low-level modules inherit or implement the abstract interface. In this way, high-level modules do not directly depend on low-level modules but on the interface layer.
- Depend on abstraction.
- Design interfaces rather than implementations. Use inheritance to avoid direct binding to classes.
- Avoid transitive dependencies. Use inheritance and abstract classes to eliminate dependencies.

## Example
### Counter Example
Consider a furnace regulator that reads the current temperature from one I/O channel and controls the furnace to continue heating or stop by sending instructions to another I/O channel.
::: code-tabs
@tab Regulate.h
``` c++
const byte THERMONETER=0x86;
const byte FURNACE=0x87;
const byte ENGAGE=1;
const byte DISENGAGE=0;

void Regulate(double minTemp,double maxTemp)
{
	for(;;)
	{
		while (in(THERMONETER) > minTemp)
			wait(1);
		out(FURNACE,ENGAGE);

		while (in(THERMONETER) < maxTemp)
			wait(1);
		out(FURNACE,DISENGAGE);
		}
}
```
:::
Obviously, this code contains a lot of low-level implementation details, and this code is not very reusable.

### Positive Example
::: code-tabs
@tab Regulate.h
``` c++
void Regulate(Thermometer t, Heater h, double minTemp,
	double maxTemp)
{
	for(;;)
	{
		while (t.Read() > minTemp)
			wait(1);
		h.Engate();

		while (t.Read() < maxTemp)
			wait(1);
		h.Disengage();
	}
}
```
